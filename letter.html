				<p>Recently it has come to my attention that many users are unhappy with the addition of advertisements in the most recent update to AsUBus (v1.39). One user in particular posted a harsh review on the App Store asking “is it really that necessary to make a couple bucks off of ads?” Unfortunately, the answer is yes, it is absolutely necessary for me to make a “couple bucks” from advertisements in order to keep the app up and running.</p>
				
				<p>You may not be aware, but AsUBus is actually the side project of a single student at App State. That student, myself, created the app because I was tired of using AppalCART’s clunky website to find route times. I have always wanted to keep AsUBus a free app, but it is not free to create and publish an application. The App Store requires hefty annual fees that are currently paid out of my pocket, along with the numerous other costs of running the AsUBus website, server hosting, and the sheer amount of time I spend working on the app to keep it up to date with the latest route and iOS changes. In order to keep these costs down for myself, a college student just like many of you, I have tried tirelessly to work with either AppalCART or the school to give the project to them after I graduate in exchange for helping me run the app financially, but have made little headway so far. So, with this financial burden, and my desire to keep the app free for all users, I had to take another route.</p>
				
				<p>Though I know advertising is not ideal, I tried to design the advertisements so that they stay out of the way and do not appear on screens where one might accidentally tap on them when trying to navigate the app (namely the map screen). Further, these advertisements will be from local vendors and advertisers, not large corporations or irrelevant companies that do not directly serve Boone NC. 
				This letter is meant to address the reasons why I have ultimately decided to introduce advertisements, and I hope that I have made it clear that it was not without necessity to actually keep the app running for another year. Please continue to leave feedback through the report button and tag your problem as “AsUBus error” if you want to suggest something or find something troubling. I personally read all of these emails and take the feedback seriously; I am also a user of the app and want the best experience possible. As well you can contact me directly through the contact form at the bottom of asubus.com, or find AsUBus on facebook and drop me a message there.</p>
				
				<p>
				I hope I have cleared up some confusion with this letter, thank you all for your continual use of the app, you guys really do rock and it has been a pleasure developing this app for your use. </p>

				<p>
				Best regards, </p>
